# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup work performed on the codebase to improve stability and documentation accuracy.

## Documentation Cleanup

### 1. Removed Duplicate Files
- **Deleted**: `settings-menu-update.md` - Duplicate of `36_settings_menu_guide.md`

### 2. Fixed Broken References
- **Fixed**: `25_enemies_legacy.md` - Updated reference from non-existent `enemies_interface_02.md` to correct `26_enemies_interface.md`

### 3. Updated Architecture Documentation
- **Modified**: `architecture_audit_summary.md` - Added warning note that refactored systems (GameSystemManager, RefactoredInGameState) are implemented but not yet integrated
- **Reason**: The game still uses the original monolithic InGameState, not the refactored version

### 4. Enhanced Index Documentation
- **Updated**: `index.md` - Added "Additional Architecture & Feature Documentation" section
- **Added References**: 
  - architecture_audit_summary.md
  - debug_features.md
  - debug_hud_improvements.md
  - placeholder_sprites.md
  - player_physics_guide.md

## Code Fixes

### 1. Fixed Null Pointer Bug in InGameState
- **File**: `states/ingame_state.go`
- **Issue**: `OnEnter()` method accessed `ig.currentRoom.GetTileMap()` before checking if `currentRoom` was nil
- **Fix**: Moved room initialization check before accessing room methods
- **Impact**: Prevents potential crash when entering game state with uninitialized room

### 2. Logger Improvements (Already Fixed)
- **Verified**: Logger bugs mentioned in `30_logging_bugs_found.md` have been addressed:
  - Empty room names now show as `<EMPTY_ROOM>`
  - Validation warnings added for invalid values
  - Empty object types handled with `<UNKNOWN_OBJECT>`

## Identified Issues Not Yet Fixed

### 1. Unimplemented Features
- **Minimap System**: `world/minimap.go` has TODO placeholders for Update() and Draw() methods
- ~~Room Transitions: Several TODOs in `world/room_transition.go` for spawn direction handling~~
  - Implemented: player now faces according to `spawn.facing_id` on spawn
- **World Map**: TODO in `world/worldmap.go` for getting display names from Room interface

### 2. Refactored Code Not Integrated
- **Location**: `states/ingame_state_refactored.go` and `systems/game_systems.go`
- **Status**: Implemented but not used - game still uses original `ingame_state.go`
- **Impact**: Architectural improvements not realized in actual gameplay

### 3. Build Dependencies
- **Issue**: Build requires X11 development libraries
- **Documentation**: Properly documented in `00_readme.md`
- **Status**: Working as intended - these are required Ebiten dependencies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Consider integrating the refactored InGameState to realize architectural improvements
2. Implement minimap rendering if this feature is desired
3. Complete room transition spawn direction handling

### Future Improvements
1. Remove or mark as deprecated the unused refactored code if not planning to integrate
2. Consider consolidating the numbered documentation files into thematic groups
3. Add automated tests to prevent regression of fixed bugs

## Summary
The codebase is in a stable state with good documentation coverage. The main architectural concern is the presence of refactored but unused code that should either be integrated or removed to avoid confusion.

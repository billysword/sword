# Metroidvania-Style Game Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to transform the game into a proper metroidvania-style platformer with appropriate window size, camera system, and room design.

## Key Changes

### 1. Window Resolution (main.go)
- Changed from 960x540 to **800x450** pixels
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio
- Larger window to show more of the zoomed-out world

### 2. Zoom Level (gamestate/state.go)
- **Tile Scale**: Reduced from 2.0 to 1.0 (tiles now render at 16x16 instead of 32x32)
- **Character Scale**: Adjusted to 0.4 to make player approximately 3 tiles wide
- **Physics Unit**: Now 16 pixels (matching the rendered tile size)
- Result: More of the world visible on screen at once

### 3. Camera System (gamestate/camera.go - NEW FILE)
- Implemented a smooth-following camera with:
  - Dead zones (25% width, 16% height) for player movement without camera motion
  - Smooth interpolation (10% smoothing factor)
  - World boundary constraints with margins for HUD elements
  - Parallax background scrolling (30% speed)
  - Helper methods for coordinate conversion and visibility checks

### 4. Room Size
- Increased room size to **120x60 tiles** (1920x960 pixels)
- This creates a massive explorable area with the 800x450 viewport
- Added extensive platform layouts:
  - 5 lower platforms (heights 35-39)
  - 5 mid-level platforms (heights 25-30)
  - 4 high platforms (heights 14-18)
  - 3 very high platforms (heights 7-9)
- Added 6 wall structures throughout the room for vertical navigation
- Decorative floating tiles for visual interest

### 5. Physics Adjustments (gamestate/player.go)
- **Movement Speed**: Reduced from 4 to 3 units (adjusted for smaller scale)
- **Jump Height**: Reduced from 10 to 8 units
- **Friction**: Reduced from 4 to 2 for smoother movement
- **Gravity**: Reduced from 8 to 4, max velocity from 20 to 15 units

### 6. Rendering Updates
- **InGameState** (gamestate/ingame_state.go):
  - Added camera instance and updates
  - Modified Draw method to apply camera transformations
  - Added camera position to debug info
  
- **Player** (gamestate/player.go):
  - Added `DrawWithCamera` method for camera-relative rendering
  - Player now appears approximately 3 tiles wide as requested
  
- **Room Interface** (gamestate/room.go):
  - Added `DrawWithCamera` method to interface
  - Added `DrawTilesWithCamera` method for tile rendering with offset
  

### 7. Debug Features (gamestate/state.go)
- Added `DrawGridWithCamera` function that moves the debug grid with the camera
- Grid lines properly align with tiles regardless of camera position

## Visual Scale Comparison
- **Before**: Tiles were 32x32 pixels, player was about 1.5 tiles wide
- **After**: Tiles are 16x16 pixels, player is approximately 3 tiles wide
- **Viewport**: Shows approximately 50x28 tiles (vs 20x11 before)

## Benefits
1. **Better Overview**: Players can see much more of the level at once
2. **Exploration**: The massive room size (120x60) provides extensive exploration
3. **Player Size**: At ~3 tiles wide, the player has better visual presence
4. **Performance**: Smaller tile rendering can be more efficient
5. **Level Design**: More room for complex platforming challenges
6. **Professional Feel**: The zoom level matches many successful metroidvania games

# Game Quit/Hanging Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified

Based on analysis of the codebase, several potential causes for the game hanging when trying to quit were identified:

### 1. **Missing Signal Handling**
- **Problem**: The game didn't handle interrupt signals (Ctrl+C/SIGINT) properly
- **Symptom**: When pressing Ctrl+C in terminal, the process would hang instead of terminating cleanly
- **Root Cause**: No signal handlers to catch and respond to termination requests

### 2. **Logger Resource Cleanup**
- **Problem**: Logger file handle could remain open during forced termination
- **Symptom**: File handles not properly closed, potential for blocking on file I/O
- **Root Cause**: `defer` statements might not execute during panic or forced exit

### 3. **Missing Context Cancellation**
- **Problem**: No way to signal shutdown to the main game loop from external sources
- **Symptom**: Game loop continues running even when termination is requested
- **Root Cause**: No context-based cancellation mechanism

### 4. **Inadequate Quit Key Handling**
- **Problem**: Limited quit options within the game states
- **Symptom**: Players forced to use Ctrl+C instead of graceful quit keys
- **Root Cause**: Only ESC for pause, no direct quit shortcuts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Proper Signal Handling** (`main.go`)
```go
// Set up signal handling for graceful shutdown
sigChan := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
signal.Notify(sigChan, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

// Start signal handler in a goroutine
go func() {
    <-sigChan
    engine.LogInfo("Received interrupt signal, shutting down gracefully...")
    game.Shutdown()
}()
```

### 2. **Implemented Context-Based Cancellation** (`main.go`)
```go
type Game struct {
    stateManager *engine.StateManager
    ctx          context.Context      // Context for cancellation support
    cancel       context.CancelFunc   // Cancel function for graceful shutdown
}

func (g *Game) Update() error {
    // Check if context is cancelled (shutdown requested)
    select {
    case <-g.ctx.Done():
        return ebiten.Termination
    default:
    }
    // ... rest of update logic
}
```

### 3. **Improved Logger Cleanup** (`engine/logger.go`)
```go
func (l *Logger) Close() error {
    l.mutex.Lock()
    defer l.mutex.Unlock()
    if l.file != nil {
        l.LogInfo("=== Game Logger Closing ===")
        // Flush any pending writes
        l.file.Sync()
        err := l.file.Close()
        l.file = nil // Prevent double-close
        return err
    }
    return nil
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Quit Key Support**
Added `Ctrl+Q` and `Alt+F4` quit shortcuts to all game states:

**InGame State** (`states/ingame_state.go`):
```go
// Check for quit (Alt+F4 style quit)
if (ebiten.IsKeyPressed(ebiten.KeyAlt) && inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed(ebiten.KeyF4)) {
    engine.LogPlayerInput("Alt+F4 (Quit)", playerX, playerY, roomName)
    return ebiten.Termination
}
```

**Pause State** (`states/pause_state.go`):
```go
// Check for forced quit (Alt+F4)
if (ebiten.IsKeyPressed(ebiten.KeyAlt) && inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed(ebiten.KeyF4)) {
    return ebiten.Termination
}
```

**Settings State** (`states/settings_state.go`):
```go
// Check for forced quit first (Alt+F4)
if (ebiten.IsKeyPressed(ebiten.KeyAlt) && inpututil.IsKeyJustPressed(ebiten.KeyF4)) {
    return ebiten.Termination
}
```

### 5. **Robust Cleanup on Exit** (`main.go`)
```go
// Ensure cleanup happens no matter how we exit
defer func() {
    engine.LogInfo("Game cleanup starting...")
    game.Shutdown()
    
    // Close logger last
    if err := engine.CloseLogger(); err != nil {
        // Can't log this since logger is closing, just print to stderr
        os.Stderr.WriteString("Error closing logger: " + err.Error() + "\n")
    }
}()
```

### 6. **Improved Error Handling**
```go
if err := ebiten.RunGame(game); err != nil {
    if err == ebiten.Termination {
        engine.LogInfo("Game terminated normally")
    } else {
        engine.LogInfo("Game ended with error: " + err.Error())
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

## Logging System Improvements

### **Enhanced Logger with Directory Structure** (`engine/logger.go`)
```go
// Creates logs directory automatically
logsDir := "logs"
if err = os.MkdirAll(logsDir, 0755); err != nil {
    return
}

// Creates timestamped log files
timestamp := time.Now().Format("2006-01-02_15-04-05")
filename = fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s%s", baseName, timestamp, ext)
logPath := filepath.Join(logsDir, filename)
```

### **Log File Features:**
- **Timestamped Filenames**: `game_2025-08-02_15-30-45.log`
- **Organized Directory**: All logs stored in `logs/` directory
- **Multiple Log Types**: INFO, DEBUG, SPRITE, ROOM_TILE, PLAYER_INPUT, ROOM_LAYOUT
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Proper file handle closing and flushing
- **Thread Safe**: Mutex-protected logging operations

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handlers ensure the game can respond to Ctrl+C properly
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Logger and other resources are properly closed on exit
3. **Multiple Quit Options**: Players can use Alt+F4, Ctrl+C, or menu options to quit
4. **No Hanging**: Context cancellation prevents the game loop from continuing during shutdown
5. **Better Logging**: All quit events are logged for debugging purposes with timestamps
6. **Prevent Double-Close**: Logger prevents multiple close attempts that could cause errors
7. **Organized Logs**: Timestamped log files in dedicated directory for better debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Signal Handling**: Test Ctrl+C in terminal - should quit cleanly
2. **Quit Keys**: Test Alt+F4 from different game states
3. **Menu Quit**: Use the "Quit" option in the start menu
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Check that timestamped log files in `logs/` directory are properly closed after quit
5. **No Hanging**: Verify terminal returns to prompt immediately after quit

## Usage Instructions

### For Players:
- **Ctrl+C**: Quit from terminal (signal-based)
- **Alt+F4**: Alternative quit shortcut (Windows-style)
- **Menu Quit**: Use "Quit" option in main menu
- **ESC**: Pause game (then Q to quit to menu)

### For Developers:
- All quit events are logged to timestamped files in `logs/` directory
- Log files use format: `game_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`
- Use `game.Shutdown()` to trigger graceful shutdown from code
- Context cancellation can be used for programmatic shutdown
- Signal handling works with debuggers and process managers
- `logs/` directory is automatically created and is in `.gitignore`

These fixes should resolve the hanging issues when quitting the game and provide multiple reliable ways to exit the application cleanly.

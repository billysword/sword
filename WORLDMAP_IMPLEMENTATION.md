# World Map System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive world map system for the Go/Ebiten game engine that tracks discovered rooms as players explore and provides both mini-map overlay and spatial room relationship management.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### Core Data Structures (`world/worldmap.go`)

#### **DiscoveredRoom**
- Tracks discovered room metadata (ID, name, bounds, exploration status)
- Stores room thumbnail data for mini-map rendering
- Manages exit points and connections to other rooms
- Tracks world position for spatial layout

#### **WorldMap Manager**
- Thread-safe room discovery and connection management
- Player position trail tracking (last 100 positions)
- Spatial room positioning with automatic conflict resolution
- JSON serialization for save/load functionality

#### **Direction System**
- Complete direction enum (N/S/E/W + diagonals + Up/Down)
- Automatic reverse direction mapping for bidirectional connections
- String representation for debugging

### Mini-Map Visualization (`world/minimap.go`)

#### **MiniMapRenderer**
- Real-time mini-map overlay in top-right corner (150x150px)
- Current room layout with simplified tile representation
- Player position and facing direction indicator
- Recent movement trail with fading alpha effect
- Adjacent room outlines for connected areas
- Exit point indicators (green dots)
- Toggleable visibility (M key)

#### **Visual Features**
- Semi-transparent background with white border
- Room tiles rendered based on tile type (solid vs empty)
- Player shown as red dot with directional arrow
- Movement trail in yellow with fade effect
- Connected exits shown as green indicators

### Game Integration (`states/ingame_state.go`)

#### **InGameState Integration**
- WorldMap and MiniMapRenderer added to game state
- Automatic room discovery on game start
- Real-time player position tracking
- Room change detection for future multi-room support
- Mini-map toggle with M key input

#### **Player Enhancement (`entities/player.go`)**
- Added facing direction tracking (facingRight bool)
- New IsFacingRight() method for mini-map orientation
- Automatic direction updates based on movement input

### Testing (`world/worldmap_test.go`)

#### **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- World map creation and initialization
- Room discovery and metadata tracking
- Room connections with bidirectional links
- Player trail management
- Map bounds calculation
- Direction helper functions
- Thumbnail generation
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Mock room implementation for testing

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

### In-Game Controls
- **M Key**: Toggle mini-map visibility
- **Move with A/D or Arrow Keys**: Updates facing direction and position trail
- **Jump with Space**: Normal game controls still work

### Mini-Map Features
- **Red Dot**: Player position with facing arrow
- **Gray Rectangles**: Current room layout (simplified tiles)
- **Gray Outlines**: Adjacent connected rooms
- **Green Dots**: Exit points to other rooms
- **Yellow Trail**: Recent player movement (fades over time)

### Developer API

#### Basic World Map Usage
```go
// Create world map
worldMap := world.NewWorldMap()

// Discover a room
worldMap.DiscoverRoom(room)
worldMap.SetCurrentRoom(room.GetZoneID())

// Connect rooms (for multi-room games)
err := worldMap.ConnectRooms("room1", world.East, "room2")

// Track player movement
worldMap.AddPlayerPosition(playerX, playerY)

// Get discovered data
rooms := worldMap.GetDiscoveredRooms()
connections := worldMap.GetRoomConnections("room1")
bounds := worldMap.GetMapBounds()
```

#### Mini-Map Setup
```go
// Create mini-map renderer
miniMap := world.NewMiniMapRenderer(worldMap, 150, x, y)

// In game loop
miniMap.Draw(screen, player) // Draws overlay
miniMap.ToggleVisible()      // Toggle visibility
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Integration Points
1. **Non-Intrusive**: Extends existing Room interface without breaking changes
2. **State Management**: Integrates with existing StateManager pattern
3. **Thread Safety**: Uses RWMutex for concurrent access
4. **Memory Efficient**: Limited trail size, thumbnail generation

### Data Flow
```
Player Input ‚Üí Player.Update() ‚Üí WorldMap.AddPlayerPosition() 
     ‚Üì
InGameState.Update() ‚Üí Room Discovery Check ‚Üí WorldMap.DiscoverRoom()
     ‚Üì
InGameState.Draw() ‚Üí MiniMapRenderer.Draw() ‚Üí Screen Overlay
```

### Spatial Algorithm
- Rooms positioned relative to connected rooms
- Automatic conflict resolution for overlapping rooms
- Padding between rooms for clear separation
- World coordinate system independent of screen coordinates

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Performance Considerations
- **O(1) Room Lookup**: Hash map for discovered rooms
- **Limited Trail**: Max 100 player positions in memory
- **Thumbnail Caching**: Pre-generated room thumbnails (max 32x32)
- **Lazy Rendering**: Mini-map only draws when visible

### Memory Usage
- Room thumbnails: ~1KB per room (32x32 int array)
- Player trail: ~800 bytes (100 positions √ó 8 bytes)
- Room metadata: ~200 bytes per room
- Total overhead: Minimal (<10KB for typical game)

### Thread Safety
- All WorldMap operations use RWMutex
- GetDiscoveredRooms() returns deep copies
- Player trail access is synchronized
- No race conditions in multi-threaded scenarios
